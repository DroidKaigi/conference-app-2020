/**
 * Runs multiple [Transition]s sequentially.
 *
 * Setting a duration to this set will distribute the duration to each child transition based on its
 * weight. Interpolator is also segmented and applied to the transitions.
 *
 * (Background) A normal [TransitionSet] simply sets its properties to child transitions as they
 * are. This can be problematic for sequential transition sets. For example, setting a duration of
 * 300ms means that the entire duration will be the multiple of 300ms and the child count.
